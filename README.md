"# Grey.co-clone" 

This project is a clone of the Grey.co website, created using only HTML and CSS. Despite using no JavaScript, I was able to achieve animations, responsive design, and a functional navigation bar. Below are the details of the features implemented in this project. 
## Features ### 
1. **Animations** - **Opacity and Transformations**: Leveraging CSS, I created animations using the `:checked` pseudo-class and transformations such as `scale`. This allows for dynamic changes in opacity and size of elements, creating engaging visual effects. 
### 
2. **Responsive Design** - **Media Queries**: The page is fully responsive across all devices, with breakpoints at max-widths of 991px, 800px, 700px up to 200px. This ensures that the layout adjusts smoothly to different screen sizes. - 
**Centered Layout**: Every image and content block is centered, ensuring that even when zooming in and out, all elements remain flexible, relative, and perfectly centered.
 ### 3. 
 **Navigation Bar** - **Checkbox-based Navigation**: The navigation bar is built using a combination of checkboxes and the `:checked` pseudo-class. When the navbar is minimized, it can be expanded and collapsed with smooth transitions, making it intuitive on both desktop and mobile devices. 
 ### 4. 
 **Favicons** - Favicons are included to enhance the aesthetic and user experience. 
 ### 5.
  **Image Handling** - **Original and Improvised Images**: Most images were sourced directly from the original Grey.co website. However, for those I couldnâ€™t obtain, I improvised with suitable replacements. 
  ### 6. 
  **Areas for Improvement** - **Sliders**: The sliders are currently unresponsive, but I plan to address this in future updates. - **Language Switcher**: The language change feature is not yet complete and will be finished in subsequent iterations.
   ## Project Structure - `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage. - `styles.css`: The CSS file containing all styling, animations, and media queries. ## Future Enhancements - Make the sliders responsive across all devices. - Complete the language change functionality. - Add more interactivity and enhance existing animations.
   ## How to Run 1. Clone the repository: ```bash git clone https://github.com/Odunsegun/Grey.co-clone.git
